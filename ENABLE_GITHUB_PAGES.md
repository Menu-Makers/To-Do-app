## The Error You're Seeing:
```

main.jsx:1
```

## Why This Happens:
‚ùå GitHub Pages is **NOT enabled yet** on your repository
‚ùå The site exists at the wrong URL

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION - Follow These Steps:

### Step 1: Go to GitHub Pages Settings
Visit this exact link:
**https://github.com/Menu-Makers/To-Do-app/settings/pages**

### Step 2: Configure Source
Look for **"Build and deployment"** section
- Under **"Source"**: 
  - Click the dropdown
  - Select: **GitHub Actions** 
  - (NOT "Deploy from a branch")

### Step 3: Trigger Deployment
After saving, push any small change to trigger the workflow:

```powershell
# Make a small change
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger GitHub Pages deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Watch Deployment
- Go to: https://github.com/Menu-Makers/To-Do-app/actions
- Wait for "Deploy to GitHub Pages" to complete (2-3 minutes)
- Look for green checkmark ‚úÖ

### Step 5: Access Your Live App
Once deployed, visit:
**https://menu-makers.github.io/To-Do-app/**

```powershell
git commit --allow-empty -m "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
git push origin main
```
