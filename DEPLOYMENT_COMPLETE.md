## 🚀 Next Steps - Enable GitHub Pages

### Go to GitHub and Enable Pages:

   https://github.com/Menu-Makers/To-Do-app

2. **Click "Settings"** (top menu bar)

3. **Click "Pages"** (left sidebar under "Code and automation")

4. **Under "Source", select:**
   - Source: **GitHub Actions** (not "Deploy from a branch")

5. **Save** (if there's a save button)

6. **Go to "Actions" tab** to watch the deployment
